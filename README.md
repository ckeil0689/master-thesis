# [Master thesis] Reproducable methods for network analysis of high-throughpot genomic data
## A reimplementation of a Regulatory Network for Th17 Cell Specification
[Reference method source on Cell](http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(12)01123-3)

This project is part of my master thesis at the Center for Bionformatics, University of Hamburg, and the University Medical Center (UKE) in Hamburg.

Given the information provided on the Cell page as well as [available data on NCBI GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE40918), I am building a similar version which adapts methods of the described pipeline.

The pipeline follows the 'Computational Methods' described in Ciofani et al. [1] and adaptations in response to examination of source code provided by Aviv Madar.
