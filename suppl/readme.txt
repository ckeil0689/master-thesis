mmc2 = Table S1. Literature-Curated Validation List for Genes with Critical Influence for Th17 Development or Function, Related to Figure 4
The list of known Th17-relevant genes used for computational validations is provided, including the Pubmed ID (PMID) for the supporting literature.

mmc3 = Table S2. Enrichment Scores for Identification of TFs and Regulators, Related to Figure 5
Candidate genes used in various biological screens (gain- and loss-of function) are highlighted in green, purple, and blue depending on the criteria used for their selection. Positive controls for TF recovery (STAT3, BATF, IRF4, Maf, and RORC) are highlighted in yellow.
